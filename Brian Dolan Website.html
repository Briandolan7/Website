    <p> Hello, my name is Brian Dolan and I am a freshman Finance Major from Sparta New Jersey. I just recently transferred to The University of Maine from Pace University in New York City. I also play wide receiver on the football team here at Maine. Although that I am in my first few weeks here at Maine, I can say that I feel welcome and this Universtiy already feels like home.  I am very excited to be here, and Go Black Bears!</p>
